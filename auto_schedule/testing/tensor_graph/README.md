# Tensor Graph
Use graph method to optimize tensor computations

## Todo list:
1. Add simplify:
    Currently this need is not urgent. However, to handle more complex cases, we need simplify passes.
2. An example.
    For now, I think I should hand-craft an example, and put the automatic work for a long plan.
